<h3>In Memoriam...</h3>
<div class="home">
<img src="img/photo.jpg" class="photo" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="5"> <p>Anna Wu Weakland, a noted artist whose work evolved from traditional Chinese form in ink and water color to monotype and tapestry over a 50-year career, and whose creative energy and independent, self-assured spirit fostered diverse friendships with iconic figures such as anthropologist Margaret Mead, Chinese master painter Zhang Daqian, and psychologist/psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary, died from rental failure on February 8, 2014 in her adopted hometown of Palo Alto, CA. She was 89 years old.</p>

<p>A native of Shanghai, China, Weakland graduated from the University of Shanghai and ran her own advertising agency for several years before coming to the U.S. in 1947 to live in New York and earn a master's degree in Sociology at Columbia University.</p>

<p>At Columbia, she met future husband John H. Weakland, a brilliant student who would later achieve renown as one of the originators of family therapy. According to family lore, Miss Wu flashed her large apple jade ring and John Weakland was smitten. He took an opportunity to conduct a cultural interview with Miss Wu for a class project, and their future paths were soon linked. As a young couple their academic mentors who remained good friends with the Weaklands long after Mead and Bateson divorced in 1950.</p>

<p>Although John was concerned that his strict West Virginian father might disapprove of his son's prospective mixed marriage, his worries proved unfounded- it took Anna Wu no more than a few minutes to charm and win over the old gentleman when they were first introduced.</p>

<img src="img/photo4.jpg" class="photo" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="5"><p>Shortly after received her master's degree in 1948, Weakland was living at the International House when she was introduced to Chinese scholar and master painter Wang Yachen, who was in New York to curate an exhibit of 20th century Chinese paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Wang was delighted by the accomplished young woman and immediately engaged her as his interpreter for the duration of his New York stay. This chance meeting proved a major turning point- Weakland's interest in Chinese painting grew and quickly became a passion when Wang Yachen became her mentor and her talent began to emerge under his guidance.</p>

<p>In 1953, Gregory Bateson persuaded the Weaklands to relocate to Palo Alto, CA so that John could join him in a psychology research project at the V.A. Hospital. (The Bateson Project, as it later became known, attracted many visiting academics, including then-unknown Harvard lecturer Timothy Leary.)</p>

<p>While her husband was engaged in ground-breaking systematic communications and psychotherapy research with the Bateson Project, Anna devoted her energy to studying Western art at Stanford University. This cross-fertilization of East and West eventually led to the development of her unique style. As a San Francisco Chronicle Art critic, Alfred Frankenstein later observed, "She uses Oriental inks, oriental papers, and Oriental brushmanship, plus a Western boldness of stroke and vigor in attack. She retains some of the traditional Chinese forms- rocks, plums, gourds- and sees, or brings us to see, Yosemite as a Chinese mountain valley. But she has [also] experienced much abstract expressionist painting... [and] goes over into the abstract dance of form with equal parts of virtuosity and power."</p>

<img src="img/photo3.jpg" class="photo" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="5"> <p>Following the birth of her three children between 1958 and 1960,  Weakland's creative energy reached its zenith, with fifteen one-woman shows in seven years. In contrast with her diminutive size, Weakland created large and sometimes monumental scrolls, and the quality of her artwork during this period was recognized both domestically (with exhibits at the De Young Museum, Stanford University Art Gallery, Seattle Art Museum, and the Downtown Gallery, New York) and internationally (exhibits at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, England, the Sale International, Palacio de Bella Artes, Mexico City, the Fine Arts Gallery at the University of British Columbia, and the Chatham Gallery, Hong Kong).</p>

<p>By the end of the 60's, Weakland felt that the continual exhibition process was taking up a disproportionate amount of her time and energy, and embarked upon an extensive period of travel and discovery to recharge her creativity. In the 70's, she traveled throughout the world, often studying with other artists and scholars. It was in this period that she befriended and became a student of one of the greatest Chinese masters of the 20th century, Zhang Daqian. Although not a household name in the West, in 2011 Zhang Daqian supplanted Picasso to become #1 in Artprice's global artist rankings by auction revenue (with $550 million in sales compared to $325 million for Warhol and $315 million for Picsso). Zhang Daqian's fondness for his student is evidenced by the artwork that he dedicated to Weakland, including an elegant black ink calligraphy advising her to "follow her own path to success".</p>

<p>In 1978, Weakland was invited by Canadian Pacific Air to lead one of the first tours to China. This led to fifteen-plus years of creating and leading unique art and scenery-driven tours to her homeland.</p>

<img src="img/photo5.jpg" class="photo" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="5"><p>In the mid-80's, Weakland began the study of monotype, experimenting with different media and techniques. After travel to Japan and visits with several printers and paper-makers, Weakland ushered in a new phase in her career with the show, "Works on Paper" at Stanford Museum of Art in 1988 (now the Cantor Center for visual arts), which featured monotypes and collagraphs with dimensional surfaces.</p>

<p>Always eager to explore and learn, in 1989 Weakland traveled to Zhejiang Academy of Arts in Hangzhou, China to exchange ideas with professors and students in the painting and printmaking departments. After running into young weavers working on contemporary tapestries, she was encouraged to develop some of her monotype themes into large-scale tapestries. The resulting pieces, designed by Weakland using paper models and woven by students, use cord, twine, and rope of hemp, palm, bamboo, cotton, linen, silk, and wool in bold, textured and dimensional art tapestries, "raising a craft to the level of art," according to John D. LaPlante, professor of Asian Art History at Stanford.</p>

<p>Weakland was dedicated to her adopted hometown, Palo Alto, tirelessly demonstrating Chinese painting in the local school system and for many civic organizations. She also taught art classes at Stanford and for more than 40 years taught group lessons at her studio that were open to the public for a nominal fee (less than the cost of the paint, rice paper, and other materials that she supplied).</p>

<p>In addition to her devotion to art, travel, and family, Weakland was also a competitive A-ladder tennis player at Foothill Tennis & Swim Club, where she once played a match against a young Condoleeza Rice.</p>

<p>Weakland was recognized by "Who's Who of American Women" and was honored by Palo Alto's Avenidas "Lifetime of Achievent" in 1996.</p>

<p>She was preceded in death by her husband, John, in 1995. She is survived by her three children, Alan, of San Marino, CA, Lewis of Palo Alto, and Joan of Ames, IA, a daughter and son-in-law, and two grandchildren.</p>

<h3>Mixed Media</h3>

<div id="mixed-media" class="mixed-media" align="center">

<a href="#" class="statementlink">Artist Statement</a> - <strong>February, 1988</strong><br><br>
<div class="statement"><p>When Pat Maveety asked me to make a personal statement about my work, my immediate reaction was like a rebellious child: "Why should I use my words when my works speak for themselves?" But his gentle persuasion won out.</p>
<p>I have been a painter for thirty years, I love painting on very absorbent rice paper, using rich fresh ground Chinese ink (made by rubbing a charcoal stick on a stone) and brushes made from hair of sheep, sable, horse, camel, wild cat, or boar. When I put down spontaneous lines, dots, or dribbles, the brush strokes are alive and immediate. Sometimes, the surface of the paper becomes instant magic. For centuries, the Chinese painters called this "the spirit of the brush". I keep on working, meditating, and practicing until that certain space and time have been obtained.</p>
<p>"Monotype" indicated one of a kind; it combines etching ink on the surface of a plastic or zinc plate and printing from the plate. The process incorporated a wide variety of media, such as acrylic, watercolor, modeling paste, gel medium, sand string, lithotine solvent, glue, collage, cardboar and paper cut outs and rubber rollers. I find the freedom and direct access to many different media very exciting and challenging without limits. It gives an added dimension in comparison with painting directly on paper.</p>
<p>I am a Chinese who had formal education in China - where both paper and printing were invented- as well as in United States, and I have lived in many parts of the world. I have a passion for traveling, simply because I want to know what this earth is like and what God and man have created. Through the years, I have covered a lot of ground in my travels. There is such a wealth of resource for inspiration. I see, and am in awe of, a few basic things which are common to all men and what they have to live with: in the cosmic world- heaven (sky), earth, mountains, and waters; calligraphy- the written languages of man which are universally beautiful; the tools of man- the money that men use and the art objects which they created for every day use; religious symbols- meaningful and of vital importance for the spiritual life.</p>
<p>For the works in this exhibit, I drew inspiration from Chinese calligraphy for its fluid and expressive lines; from ancient Chinese coins which offer interesting forms and textures; from symbols of Zen, Taoism, and cosmic matters- Yin and Yang, circles and squares, mountains and waters.</p></div>

<h3>Tapestries</h3>
<div id="tapestries" class="tapestries" align="center">
<a href="#" class="statementlink">Artist Statement</a><br><br>
<div class="statement"><p>My love affair with wall tapestries happened rather accidentally. Two years ago, I visited the Zhejiang Academy of Arts in Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, the country's oldest and largest art school. I was there primarily to exchange ideas with the professors and students in the painting and printing departments. By chance one day I ran into two young artists at the academy who were doing modern tapestries - what a wonderful sight to watch them working with natural fibers, so rich in texture and color! I was overwhelmed by the desire to try this medium of expression.</p>
<p>After seeing the catalog of my monotypes, these young artists felt my work would translate well to the medium. Encoured by them, I immediately set out to design ten tapestries.</p>
<p>Chinese tapestry first came into being in the Sung Dynasty and is largely woven in silk. The subject matter is derived from Chinese paintings: flowers and birds, landscapes, bamboo and pandas. It is evident that my work is different from traditional Chinese tapestries. In the images of my work, I want to reach far back to the early Chinese language and art. After living in the West for forty years, it is important to me to return to my own cultural sources in my work, where in the inner silence of being, I find the greatness, comfort, solitude, and peace of the life force. Except in the early training of my art career under several Chinese painting masters, for the last thirty formative years of my life, I have been widely exposed to the contemporary work of modern art. Therefore, I love the excitement of vibrant colors, rich textures and the use of varies materials. And I was ready to introduce and apply all that freedom to my new work in wall tapestry.</p>
<p>With some, I made paper models with specific details in size, textures, colors, types of fiber to use, etc. so that the weavers who were trained in the traditional ways would visualize and comprehend what I wished to accomplish. I am particularly pleased with the two tapestries which I designed shortly after the tragic incident at Tiananmen Square, titled, "Renewed Hope" and "Clouds Over Forbidden City".</p>
<p>My new works thus draw on China's long and great art tradition, which offers tremendous potential for the living artist. The charming and scenic city of Hangzhou where I worked on my tapestries was also the place my family used to have a country home. It is known as the silk capital of China and has a rich heritage in both art and weaving. The city offers many raw materials such as bamboo, palm, hemp, cotton, linen, silk, wool, and a variety of ropes and strings.</p>
