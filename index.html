<h3>In Memoriam...</h3>
<a name="home">
<div class="home">
<img src="img/photo.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="5"> <p>Anna Wu Weakland, a noted artist whose work evolved from traditional Chinese form in ink and water color to monotype and tapestry over a 50-year career, and whose creative energy and independent, self-assured spirit fostered diverse friendships with iconic figures such as anthropologist Margaret Mead, Chinese master painter Zhang Daqian, and psychologist/psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary, died from rental failure on February 8, 2014 in her adopted hometown of Palo Alto, CA. She was 89 years old.</p>

<p>A native of Shanghai, China, Weakland graduated from the University of Shanghai and ran her own advertising agency for several years before coming to the U.S. in 1947 to live in New York and earn a master's degree in Sociology at Columbia University.</p>

<p>At Columbia, she met future husband John H. Weakland, a brilliant student who would later achieve renown as one of the originators of family therapy. According to family lore, Miss Wu flashed her large apple jade ring and John Weakland was smitten. He took an opportunity to conduct a cultural interview with Miss Wu for a class project, and their future paths were soon linked. As a young couple their academic mentors who remained good friends with the Weaklands long after Mead and Bateson divorced in 1950.</p>

<p>Although John was concerned that his strict West Virginian father might disapprove of his son's prospective mixed marriage, his worries proved unfounded- it took Anna Wu no more than a few minutes to charm and win over the old gentleman when they were first introduced.</p>

<p>Shortly after received her master's degree in 1948, Weakland was living at the International House when she was introduced to Chinese scholar and master painter Wang Yachen, who was in New York to curate an exhibit of 20th century Chinese paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Wang was delighted by the accomplished young woman and immediately engaged her as his interpreter for the duration of his New York stay. This chance meeting proved a major turning point- Weakland's interest in Chinese painting grew and quickly became a passion when Wang Yachen became her mentor and her talent began to emerge under his guidance.</p>

<p>In 1953, Gregory Bateson persuaded the Weaklands to relocate to Palo Alto, CA so that John could join him in a psychology research project at the V.A. Hospital. (The Bateson Project, as it later became known, attracted many visiting academics, including then-unknown Harvard lecturer Timothy Leary.)</p>

<p>While her husband was engaged in ground-breaking systematic communications and psychotherapy research with the Bateson Project, Anna devoted her energy to studying Western art at Stanford University. This cross-fertilization of East and West eventually led to the development of her unique style. As a San Francisco Chronicle Art critic, Alfred Frankenstein later observed, "She uses Oriental inks, oriental papers, and Oriental brushmanship, plus a Western boldness of stroke and vigor in attack. She retains some of the traditional Chinese forms- rocks, plums, gourds- and sees, or brings us to see, Yosemite as a Chinese mountain valley. But she has [also] experienced much abstract expressionist painting... [and] goes over into the abstract dance of form with equal parts of virtuosity and power."</p>

<p>Following the birth of her three children between 1958 and 1960,  Weakland's creative energy reached its zenith, with fifteen one-woman shows in seven years. In contrast with her diminutive size, Weakland created large and sometimes monumental scrolls, and the quality of her artwork during this period was recognized both domestically (with exhibits at the De Young Museum, Stanford University Art Gallery, Seattle Art Museum, and the Downtown Gallery, New York) and internationally (exhibits at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, England, the Sale International, Palacio de Bella Artes, Mexico City, the Fine Arts Gallery at the University of British Columbia, and the Chatham Gallery, Hong Kong).</p>

<p>By the end of the 60's, Weakland felt that the continual exhibition process was taking up a disproportionate amount of her time and energy, and embarked upon an extensive period of travel and discovery to recharge her creativity. In the 70's, she traveled throughout the world, often studying with other artists and scholars. It was in this period that she befriended and became a student of one of the greatest Chinese masters of the 20th century, Zhang Daqian. Although not a household name in the West, in 2011 Zhang Daqian supplanted Picasso to become #1 in Artprice's global artist rankings by auction revenue (with $550 million in sales compared to $325 million for Warhol and $315 million for Picsso). Zhang Daqian's fondness for his student is evidenced by the artwork that he dedicated to Weakland, including an elegant black ink calligraphy advising her to "follow her own path to success".</p>

<p>In 1978, Weakland was invited by Canadian Pacific Air to lead one of the first tours to China. This led to fifteen-plus years of creating and leading unique art and scenery-driven tours to her homeland.</p>

<p>In the mid-80's, Weakland began the study of monotype, experimenting with different media and techniques. After travel to Japan and visits with several printers and paper-makers, Weakland ushered in a new phase in her career with the show, "Works on Paper" at Stanford Museum of Art in 1988 (now the Cantor Center for visual arts), which featured monotypes and collagraphs with dimensional surfaces.</p>

<p>Always eager to explore and learn, in 1989 Weakland traveled to Zhejiang Academy of Arts in Hangzhou, China to exchange ideas with professors and students in the painting and printmaking departments. After running into young weavers working on contemporary tapestries, she was encouraged to develop some of her monotype themes into large-scale tapestries. The resulting pieces, designed by Weakland using paper models and woven by students, use cord, twine, and rope of hemp, palm, bamboo, cotton, linen, silk, and wool in bold, textured and dimensional art tapestries, "raising a craft to the level of art," according to John D. LaPlante, professor of Asian Art History at Stanford.</p>

<p>Weakland was dedicated to her adopted hometown, Palo Alto, tirelessly demonstrating Chinese painting in the local school system and for many civic organizations. She also taught art classes at Stanford and for more than 40 years taught group lessons at her studio that were open to the public for a nominal fee (less than the cost of the paint, rice paper, and other materials that she supplied).</p>

<p>In addition to her devotion to art, travel, and family, Weakland was also a competitive A-ladder tennis player at Foothill Tennis & Swim Club, where she once played a match against a young Condoleeza Rice.</p>

<p>Weakland was recognized by "Who's Who of American Women" and was honored by Palo Alto's Avenidas "Lifetime of Achievent" in 1996.</p>

<p>She was preceded in death by her husband, John, in 1995. She is survived by her three children, Alan, of San Marino, CA, Lewis of Palo Alto, and Joan of Ames, IA, a daughter and son-in-law, and two grandchildren.</p>
